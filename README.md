# A Retrospective Evaluation of COVID-19 Case Forecasts in the UK:
This repository contains R code and data for evaluating COVID-19 case forecasts for the UK. It compares predicted cases (from a CSV file) with observed data from the COVID19 R package, visualises the results,and calculates forecast perfromance metrics (MAE, MSE & RMSE).

## Summary:
Forecasting is a key objective of infectious disease modelling and plays a vital role in informing public health decisions during outbreaks and epidemics. It helps public health officials, policymakers and healthcare providers anticipate healthcare demands, guide resource allocation, and support timely intervention planning.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Epiforecasts Group at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) produced real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases at the national level. However, these forecasts were only shared as tabular content and data visualisations through dashboards, with no formal evaluations being conducted to asses their accuracy.

This project was built throughout an eight-week summer internship at the LSHTM organised through Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).
