# A Retrospective Evaluation of COVID-19 Case Forecasts at the UK Sub-National Level:
R script that evaluates the accuracy of predicted case data when compared to observed case data and baseline forecasts through the utilisation of accuracy metrics

## Summary:
Forecasting is a key objective of infectious disease modelling and plays a vital role in informing public health decisions during outbreaks and epidemics. It helps public health officials, policymakers and healthcare providers anticipate healthcare demands, guide resource allocation, and support timely intervention planning.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Epiforecasts Group at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) produced real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases at the sub-national level. However, these forecasts were only shared as tabular content and data visulaisations through dashboards, with no formal evaluations being conducted to asses their accuracy.
